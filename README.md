## Bingo Card - Angular

As a class, we built a bingo card generator where the numbers are randomly generated and a player can win the game with straight lines.  As an assignment, we coded the different parameters to win the game.  One rule to follow was that we could not hard code numbers as the parameter to give the game more flexibility.  I used different Underscore methods to keep the code as generic as possible.
