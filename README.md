## Bingo Card - Angular

The bingo card generator was initial built as a class.  The first iteration of the game allows the player to win with straight lines.  Individually, we were tasked to code the other iterations of the game without hard coding in the numbers.  This was achieved by using $scope and underscore methods to keep the card as generic as possible.
